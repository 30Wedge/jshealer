##Play Now##  

If you are anxious to join the fight (and who wouldn't be), then all you need to do is fork this repo and let us know your username and repo name on sign-up. It really is that easy. We have a lot of shenanigans going on in the background to make this happen and we have tried to make this process as seamless as possible.


####Steps To Play Now####

1. If you haven't already, please sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/join).
2. After signing up, navigate back to this page and at the top right of your screen, click the 'Fork' button.
3. When you click the 'Fork' button, you will be asked where you want to fork this repo. Go ahead and click your repo. This will effectively copy this repo into your repo.
4. BAM!!! Now, you have a working repo in your account! Nice! 
5. The only things left to do is navigate to the [Javascript Battle](http://javascriptbattle.com/) website and sign up. Make sure you tell us the name of your repo. 
  * **Hint** - You can find this info by looking at the url when you are in your repo. For example, the url for my repo is 'github.com/forrestbthomas/hero-starter'. My username is 'forrestbthomas' and my repo name is 'hero-starter'.
6. At this point, you have a working repo, with working hero code and you can watch your hero tilt with the best in tomorrow's battle. Once you are ready, you can begin diving in to the code, to make your hero even stronger and make Javascript Battle even more glorious!

##Advanced Play##

1. Cloning, Adding and Committing
2. The Hero's Brain
3. Pushing and Waiting

####Cloning, Adding and Committing####
You already have a working hero. You have watched the epic-ness that is your champion battling against other noble heroes. However, there comes a time in every hero's journey, when training becomes necessary.
In order to upgrade your hero's code you will first need to clone your hero-starter repo on to your local machine. If you are new to Git, this may sound intimidating, but once you get the hang of it, it will become second nature. The purpose of this Readme is not to give an overview of Git, but to give you enough to get started, If you want to learn more, and we definitely recommend that you do, you can check out these great resources:
  * [Git Documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc)
  * [Youtube Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75_UrC2unv4&feature=youtu.be)
  * [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)
  * [Git Cheatsheet](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet-detail/)

####Steps####
1. Navigate to your repo and find the 'HTTPS clone URL' button, make sure you are cloning with 'HTTPS' and click the 'Copy to Clipboard' button.
2. Create a new folder on your file system somewhere and navigate to that folder in the command line.
  * If you are new to the command line, a quick Google search will return some good results for command line introductions on your OS.
3. Once there, you will need to clone your repo using the following command:
```
git clone <your clipboard-repo-url>
```
For example, to clone my repo, I would use:
```
git clone https://github.com/forrestbthomas/hero-starter.git
```
